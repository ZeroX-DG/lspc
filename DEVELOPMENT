HOW TO SETUP A DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENT
-------------------------------------

The following describe the steps to setup a minimal VIM environment
that you can use to test LSPC.

First, create a new VIM profile folder at whereever you want, with
the following folder structure, for example:

  ~/development/vim
  .
  ├── autoload
  │   └── plug.vim
  └── init.vim

You can download the plug.vim file from VimPlug repository [1]

The content of init.vim can be this simple:

  call plug#begin()
  Plug '~/code/play/lspc/'
  call plug#end()

  let g:lspc = {
      \ 'rust': {
      \     'root_markers': ['Cargo.lock'],
      \     'command': ['rustup', 'run', 'stable', 'ra_lsp_server'],
      \     },
      \ }
      
Then you can start VIM with the -u parameter pointing to your dev
profile:

  vim -u ~/development/vim/init.vim

And that's it.
